# psModules
This is a repository of my PowerShell modules. During my internship at the DEASP, I spent a good bit of time working on continous integration and automation for the release management team. I thoroughly enjoyed this and it inspired me to replicate their methods of automation: I installed a jenkins instance on one of my servers and am currently coding my own powershell modules and bash scripts in order to improve the efficiency of my automated tasks.
